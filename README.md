Hello :)

This project was my final capstone project for my HyperionDev fullstack bootcamp.
This project has been planned and wireframed. Those plans are in the Business Requirements folder.

Version 1.0 of this project has all the basic functionality required for a user to:
- Signup and/or login
- Decide if they want to be an Admin or not
- An Admin has certain capabilities that a normal user does not, such as:
    - Creating communities
    - Creating blog posts
    - Deleting blog posts
    - Admin features that will be added in the future include:
        - Deleting communities
        - Removing users from communities 
        - Updating blog posts 
        - Joining other communities
            - Right now, an admin is not allowed to join another community because there admins rights will persis in this community which will allow them to add and delete blogs in that community 
- A normal user (or Dweller) will be allowed to:
    - Join communities that they have been invited to 
    - View blog posts from several different communities
    - User features that will be added in the future include:
        - Leaving a community 
        - Adding likes and comments to a blog post

My project is not 100% complete, there are certain features missing that will be added an updated version of this project. For now, my project simply meets all the submission criteria.
